### What is a Parallax Website?

A parallax website is a type of website design that uses multiple layers of content to create a visually engaging and interactive user experience. As the user scrolls down the page, these layers move at different speeds, creating a 3D effect and adding depth to the website.

1. **Parallax Scrolling:** The website incorporates parallax scrolling effects, providing an immersive and visually appealing experience for users.

2. **Responsive Design:** The template is designed to work seamlessly on a variety of devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

3. **Sections:** The website is divided into multiple sections, allowing you to showcase different content and information in an organized manner.

5. **Smooth Transitions:** Smooth transitions between sections and parallax effects create a polished and professional feel.

- Update the content in the HTML files to reflect your project or brand.
